Da Pong:
-------
Situation: you have two tabs, cpu
1. first you need to loose at pong (won't be difficult, cpu has a cheated puck)
2. on tab1, type: "take ball"
3. on tab1, type: "kick ball" 
(note: lots of other verbs can work with commands ...)

Skill phase: win vs pong cpu

Da BSOD:
--------
Situation: on tab 2 there is a blue screen with nothing you can do.
1. on tab1, equip hammer
2. on tab2, a cursor shaped as a hammer will appear on screen, you can now click do dismantle that horrible blue screen

Da Square moon:
---------------
Situation: You have now 3 tabs, the third screen is black. (if you don't have three tabs you probably need to go back on first tab and "continue" the chat.)
1. on tab1, type 'switch on' or 'lampp on' or [...] to switch on the lampp (that will invert colors on tab 2 and display tab 3)
2. tab 3 show now a "rpg scene" where you have white boxes and a stargate, push all boxes in da stargate
3. type 'switch off' to re-invert the colors

Skill phase: 
4. on tab 2, you will see a pile of white square, climb on top of da box pile using magnetik jump. Remember that colission reset magnetik jump.
5. from top of pile, flood space to perform a magnetic fly (when the ball has finished a jump and came back to the original y position, the jump can be perfomed again, simulating kind of a flying performance)

End
---
The last scene was not finished on time (was involving classic rpg scene where you need to find a sword and kill a giant ennemy), 
as a consequence when you reach the square moon, you finished the game and got the reward (the best ever given on any game you played).
