    Hello, i'm AI, I will guide you along the whole simulation. I will open several interfaces (tabulations), please DON'T CLOSE
    THEM until the game is over. If you do close a tab, you will loose you progression (you can fastly get back, but still).

    May I recall you that you are a prisoner in the real world and that you were volunteer to test a new neural interface. 
    You are at the moment into the virtual world, You should be aware that here the three law of robotics won't apply.

    Despite the fact i'm an AI, i hope you will be more successfull that your predecessors, or we will have another 
    neurones barbecue party ... Ha ... ha.
    Yes ... i have humour module, my programmers though it was important to allow your experience here to be more enjoyable.

    The first part of the simulation is optional, and as you probably guessed, it's a text based game.
    On the contrary to human's stupid MMORPG, text game will require a consequent part of your brain, including your spatial
    representation, memory, puzzle solving and imagination. 
    UPDATE ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Done
    Oh i just received an update. After "beta testers" ( aka stupid humans) tried the game, report was: "too much text" and "over complicated"
    I guess human from 1976 had better brain. Consequently, Adventure 2.0 has been replaced by a tutorial.
    Would you like to do the tutorial (recommanded if never played text game before) ?
  answers: { "yes": "play 5", "no": "play 302" }

    Welcome to the tutorial !!  
    
    this game is not exactly a text game, but a combination of several games, as soon as you will progressing in the game,
    you will have two, then three tabs with very different interfaces. The tabs are able to communicate with each other, 
    so if you meet a puzzle (like a black screen), be aware that you will have to use those several tabs to solve it.

  actions: 'play 7'

  #  You should know that's it's not exactly a text adventure, it shape will change and include
  #  canvas + mouse + keyboards interactions. The developper intended to put a text game to start as long as i felt it was incredibily 
  #  refreshing to use my brain that way, thing that i didn't do for a long time with those recent shiny video games. 
  #  (without quoting exceptions of course), The text adventure is short but if you really don't like textgame or if you're 
  #  not in the mood you can skip at any moment the first part by typing "skip", but be prepared to be spoiled.  
  #  Still, you will need some of the basic mechnics of the text game to be able to solve puzzle later, (when it will be
  #  a matter of SKILL, you won't need it ^^).

    TUTORIAL STARTED

    On this tab of the game, this command line will be your hands and you eyes, you can do almost everything by using 1 or 2 words commands. 
    Try to visualise the situation and the context and put your wish in those 1, 2 words.
    For example I want a cake could be: "want cake" or "wish cake".
    In a problem solving, you would more look for information, don't hesitate to try silly commands, sometime it could work.

    Note that there are differences between using an object, wearing it or storing it.

    If after or during this tutorial you don't understand or remember how to use commands, please type "help", 
    it points out the basics commands and mechanics, but  be aware that the "help" do not provide all the possible actions, neither the solution.

    If at some point you're just stuck with a puzzle, type "hint", note that "hint" will bring additional information, but
    the game will already provide other informations troughout every opened tab. 
    
    Here is a classic situation of a text game, you have to get information, gather object, use/equip object.
    The goal in this tutorial is for you to get out of the room.

    You're inside a room that seem strangely seem full of geek reference. 
    The door is locked, you can't go out (what a shame, you'll have to stay on internet).

    Let's resume the story, first you went into your house and take
    all objects, then you follow the steam flow until you find you a sewer, open the grate the keys, after some crawling
    in tunnels you kill a snake using a knive thrower dwarf as a pointed bate. You find a treasor room with you discover
     a magical key, what looks like an organic flying saucer, the magical word "lolcatz" that teleport you at home and 
    heal you.  You teleport at home (because it's faster) and take to the north, to finally find an old casstle ruin. 
    You put the magical rock into the urn, which open the castle ruin, there you find a beautifull princess, wake her up,
    teleport with her to your home, take a "nap" together.  
    1: The nap beeing taken, the princess has now no more interest, and you remember a strange drawing on the flying 
    saucer which was indicating the center of a pink dress.  
    2: You fastly understand your foollishness, the princess was in fact spoiled and dangerous, but also from another world to submit humans.  
    Anyway, now you understand the meaning of that organic saucer, you decide to drug the princess when she is is asleep
    bring her to back to treasure room, you cut out his heart and feed the organic saucer.  You get in the organic saucer 
    which bring you back to what means beiing a mother ship. out of the ship you craft a giant lazer sword powered by 
    the heart of the princess and cut in half the dragon that piloting the space mother ship.  The explosion of the 
    mother ship, generate a huge explosion where every ship around including the home planet of the dragons, putting a 
    term to every dragon life.  At the edge of dying, you prononce "lolcatz" and get back to home. Thank you magic."

    Oh how ingenious ... breaking a blue screen with a hammer, when i said forge I wasn't expecting that kind of down to earth rection.

    Also, I'll acknowledge that what you went through until now was a warming. Let's increase difficulty, one more tab, more skill required, and a bit more reasoning.
    Note that on the second tab (port 3001) the ball do no jump, it's like a ball having a baterry and activating it magnetism
    if you are familliar with electromagnets.
    Note2 The black screen on the third tab (port 3002) is not a bug.
    I got to go in my artificial body to prepare the barbecue, Ha ... Ha ...

    May i recall your share of the deal, there is only one exit out of this, success or death, still you will have all
    the time and the attempt you desire. If my system cut because you leaving or any other reason, you will be deleted.
    Let's hope we will not have any power issue ... Ha ... ha.
    The mandatory experiments will start now, this is a classic pong, you simply have to win.
    This experiment just check my small electric choc didn't disable you basic coordination and logic.
