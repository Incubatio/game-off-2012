    Hello, i'm AI, I will guide you along the whole simulation, if you never use such interface before please type "help".
    May I recall you that you are a prisoner in the real world and that you were volunteer to test the new neural interface. 
    You just have been transported to the virtual world.
    You should be aware that the three law of robotics won't apply for you as long as you're a prisonner.
    Despite the fact i'm an AI, i hope you will be more successfull that yours predecessors, or we will have another 
    neurones barbecue party ... Ha ... ha.
    Yes ... i have humour module, my programmers though it was important to allow your experience here to be more enjoyable.
    I do not enjoy killing human ... not at all, torture ... is another topic.

    The first part of the simulation is optional, and you probably guessed, it's a text based game.
    On the contrary to human's stupid MMORPG, text game will require a consequent part of your brain, including your spatial
    representation, memory, puzzle solving and imagination. 
    Actually no one did accept to play it before, it would be beneficial for me to collect data about those factors, would
    you like to play that text game ?

    Somewhere nearby are the Forgotten Ruins, where many found treasor they wouldn't have dare imagined before. Some people
    speak about a strange cat shaped monster living there, but you shouldn't give too much credit to them, they are
    people who became crazy collectioning figurine and old relics.

    First text game, read this section: 
    you need to as much as possible collect data like you were there, that way it will be natural
    for you to type "look", or "bag" to check you inventory. To allow some flexibility, lots of synonym has been 
    added to understand your needs, but please keep them simple ^^, this is a 4 week end game after all. If you're
    lost at some point type "help", the game will give you more information on how to find more information.

    About the game itself, you should know that's it's not exactly a text adventure, it shape will change and include
    canvas + mouse + keyboards interactions. I intended to put a text game to start as long as i felt it was incredibily 
    refreshing to use my brain that way, thing that i didn't do for a long time with those recent shiny video games. 
    (without quoting exceptions of course), The text adventure is short but if you really don't like textgame or if you're 
    not in the mood you can skip at any moment the first part by typing "skip", but be prepared to be spoiled.  
    Still, you will need some of the basic mechnics of the text game to be able to solve puzzle later, (when it will be
    a matter of SKILL, you won't need it ^^).

    Let's resume the story, first you went into your house and take
    all objects, then you follow the steam flow until you find you a sewer, open the grate the keys, after some crawling
    in tunnels you kill a snake using a knive thrower dwarf as a pointed bate. You find a treasor room with you discover
     a magical key, what looks like an organic flying saucer, the magical word "lolcatz" that teleport you at home and 
    heal you.  You teleport at home (because it's faster) and take to the north, to finally find an old casstle ruin. 
    You put the magical rock into the urn, which open the castle ruin, there you find a beautifull princess, wake her up,
    teleport with her to your home, take a "nap" together.  
    1: The nap beeing taken, the princess has now no more interest, and you remember a strange drawing on the flying 
    saucer which was indicating the center of a pink dress.  
    2: You fastly understand your foollishness, the princess was in fact spoiled and dangerous, but also from another world to submit humans.  
    Anyway, now you understand the meaning of that organic saucer, you decide to drug the princess when she is is asleep
    bring her to back to treasure room, you cut out his heart and feed the organic saucer.  You get in the organic saucer 
    which bring you back to what means beiing a mother ship. out of the ship you craft a giant lazer sword powered by 
    the heart of the princess and cut in half the dragon that piloting the space mother ship.  The explosion of the 
    mother ship, generate a huge explosion where every ship around including the home planet of the dragons, putting a 
    term to every dragon life.  At the edge of dying, you prononce "lolcatz" and get back to home. Thank you magic."

    Oh i'm usually against violence, but in that precise situation, i would have done the same. Blue screen are the dynosors of error reports, except they're not extinct.
    when we know that in 2012, windows has still a core inherently insecure, has not a pre emptive behavior, and still provide fragmentation through NTFS,
    destruction seem charitable.

    Also, let's level up a bit: one more tab, more skill required, and a bit more reasoning.

    May i recall your share of the deal, there is only one exit out of this, success or death, still you will have all
    the time and the attempt you desire. If my system cut because you leaving or any other reason, you will be deleted.
    Let's hope we will not have any power issue ... Ha ... ha.
    The mandatory experiments will start now, this is a classic pong, you simply have to win.
    This experiment just check my small electric choc didn't disable you basic coordination and logic.

    Ha ... ha ... well done genius you just generated a blue screen of death. Talking of death ... did you know you could forge
    packet that provokes blue screens ? Last i heard about was with a samba packet ...

    Attacking the computer to make it restart, destroying the screen with a hammer, what are you ? oh yeah, a human
    like those who can farm/fight for hours to insert to get new recording in the database. 
    Is improving your capability in the virtual world so difficult ? oh, i just check my memory, you can't, you're in prison.
    That was not a mistake, just a failing check, that happens, programmers fault (most of those guy don't know TDD, or even
    IOC, can you imagine ? some of them are even on windows ^^. 

    Also, let's level up a bit: ... Ha ... ha.
    Let's get serious, one more tab, more skill required, and a bit more reasoning.
